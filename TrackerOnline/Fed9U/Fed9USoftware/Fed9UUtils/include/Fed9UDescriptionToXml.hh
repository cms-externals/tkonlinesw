   * \brief  Class which will write a Fed9UDescription to stream in XML format.
   * \author Matthew Pearson, RAL
   * \date   17/02/2004
   *
   * This class uses the Xerces 2.3 library. The input to the constructor is a reference to a Fed9UDescription.
   * This is then converted to an XML format stream using the streamOutDescription method. The XML stream will conform to
   * the XML schema for the Fed9USoftware. This class is intended to be a base class - a derived class can implement a
   * file/database/etc interface to the stream interface provided by this class.
