This directory contains kernel driver for FTDI 245BM chip.
It is used to access CMS Preshower testboard FEC core (from 
Christer) via USB bus. You do not need to load this driver
unless you use FECUSB boards. Do not erase this directory, 
it is needed for FecUsbDriver library creation (libfec_usb_glue.a). 
In case you like to use FECUSB please contact me for driver 
installation instructions.
